<p> Lots of articles on this topic are really toxic, Social Media isn't as bad as it seems. When approached properly. Most of the time,
it is. It's healthy to just post ever so occasionally or to flick through  your feed for a couple minutes daily. The problems arise when
people post 7 times a day, and sit on social media for hours at a time. I would argue that chat apps like Discord and WhatsApp are the
apps you should really be checking every hour or so. but even then, Just open the app for a couple seconds and check your messages then
just close the app and check again later. TikTok is REALLY unhealthy for teenagers and younger users because of all the bad videos
that are made on the platforms. Do NOT Let yourself onto this platform. Just one look at  it, and you see what I mean. Lots of people want
to post Life-Threatening challenges, and overall stupidity. What's worse is that the audience are made up of impressionable children.
 It's healthy to post about your life to your family and friends, so you can stay connected. That was the point of social media, But the
whole thing got messed up when all sorts of stupidity was posted and rapidly grew to become a trend. Don't Post any private information.
It's Okay to USE social media. You just have to keep track of yourself and your habits. If you find yourself using social media too much,
Make sure to do other activities to keep yourself distracted from your phone. Like Biking? Go pedal around town. Or if you have a pet,
you should take it for a walk. Lots of articles tell you to just quit altogether. You just need to keep it in that corner of your life,
It just can't be more than 30% of your life. Once that's under control, You can find other things to do that will be fun. Had any hobbies
that didn't hold through? You now have the time to pick those up again. And you can learn new things. When everything if balanced, then
you won't be as stressed. Feeling tired? Take a Nap. That time you used with social media was a waste. Keep a schedule, even if you have
a lot of free time,have that time in the morning where most people flick through a feed and minimize that time to a couple minutes maybe
5 to 15 minutes is the time I would recommend.</p>
