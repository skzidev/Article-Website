<p>So, Over quarentine, I found myself playing more video games than normal, And for those who don't game as much anymore. Here is my expirience  with video games in 2021.</p>

<h4>Call of Duty: Warzone</h4>
<p>I have a internet speed of 100mbps up and 200mbps down to get that out of the way. I also have a intel core i5 9600k
16 gb of ram, and a GeForce GT 1030 GPU. On that I am getting very smooth preformence at 70 fps the only thing about it is that I get smooth preformence and then it might drop fps or even freeze. My gaming rig preforms like a beast though, so if you have a LG Gram, you won't be able to really play the game. I normally average about 10-20 kills every game. I am new to the game, though. CoD Warzone Preformed great until my computer started to get hot. Recently, I got a fan to point at my PC to cool it down, And it's been working. I get better preformence because there is less thermal throttling and I got my PC to run cool so I don't have to take as many breaks to let it cool down. Next I'm gonna talk about is timing. I have more time to play games right now because I don't have school Even if I had school, I have more time on my hands and I got more games to play. Overall, CoD Warzone Preformed great and I had more time to play it.</p>

<h4>Rocket Leauge</h4>
<p>Next up, Rocket Leauge. Same Internet, Specs and all that. It preformed Great, Exept for the trearing... You see, I have an Anti-Tear Monitor, I figured out though, that I needed to turn on V-Sync. THANK THE GODS OF V-SYNC, V-Sync or Vertical sync will do something.. Let google explain it. "VSync, or vertical sync, is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of a game and the refresh rate of a gaming monitor. First developed by GPU manufacturers, this tech was a way to deal with screen tearing, which is when your screen displays portions of multiple frames in one go." Thank you google. So screen tearing WAS a problem but is not anymore. Aside from that, Rocket Leauge Preforms really well. Smooth and not much freezing, if any. I Love playing the game and now that I have more time to play games it's in 2nd place of games I play most with this extra time on my hands.</p>

<h4>The Cycle:Storm Chasers</h4>
<p>So, I wanted to get into FPS titles and I thought that this would be a good start. It's good for newbies. To start, They have a Pact Feature so that player cannot hurt th>
em and they can't hurt you. Also, There are practice rounds if they don't want to go up against other prospectors *players* Then they can go up against only monsters. What else can I really say? I love the game, So I am recommending it to you. Go play it, It's free on Epic Games.</p>
