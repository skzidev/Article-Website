	<p>TechAPedia is like The Verge, CNET, or PC-MAG. I learned a bit of HTML from classes on the matter and learned how to code a bit of HTML I made another website which doesn't do anything. But I learned how to create websites. I'll link it here. <a href="https://scamstore.surge.sh/">scamstore.surge.sh</a>. anyway, I wanted to make a forum page so people can ask for help on problems but I ended up not being able to do so in the timeframe I wanted to be able to develop this website in. I am hoping to make a new feature where That forum thing happens later on.</p>
